//
// Design notes
//
// An alternative design could have the trigger tx pay to `pk($owner_pk) || (pk($heir_pk) && older($contest_period))`,
// allowing the heir to spend directly from it without requiring a 2nd pre-signed transaction.
//
// However, this would require the heir to use a specialized Miniscript-enabled wallet that can spend complex policies,
// which are (currently) not common. With the design used here, the funds end up in the heir's standard Bitcoin address
// that can be managed using any standard Bitcoin wallet. And since storing pre-signed txs is a requirement either way,
// it doesn't really matter if it's one or two.
//
// The example uses fixed fees to simplify things, but it would be better to provide an anchor output for CPFP
// and/or provide multiple sets of pre-signed txs at different fee-rates.
//
// This can also be thought of as a recovery scheme, where instead of an heir you have emergency recovery material held by a trusted friend.
// Or as a vault, where instead of an owner/heir you have the owner's cold/hot keys, and with a shorter contest period (few days to weeks).
